### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working at [Homebase](https://joinhomebase.com/) (through [Andela](https://andela.com/)).

🌱 I’m currently learning: Ruby (always!), React, Functional Programming, Crystal, Elixir, and a lot of other things!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ruby gems and other interesting open-source projects.

💬 Ask me about what are my favorite bands and songs!

📫 How to reach me: [email](mailto:danilo.barion@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilobarionnogueira/).

⚡ Fun fact: I switched my professional area many years ago, I'm a former nutritionist.
